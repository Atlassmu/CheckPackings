# CheckPackings
This program is used to compute the radius for three kinds of packings, namely, packings of equal Circles in a SQuare (CSQ), packings of equal Spheres in a CUbe (SCU), and packings of equal Circles in a Circle (CCI).
1.	The new coordinates generated by LSP (Locally Spreading Points) algorithm lie in the folder "coords/".
2.	The best-known radii downloaded from http://www.packomania.com/ lie in the files "csq_radius.txt", "scu_radius.txt", and "cci_radius.txt", respectively.
3.	The new radii computed by this program were already saved in the files "new_csq_radius.txt", "new_scu_radius.txt", and "new_cci_radius.txt", respectively. You can take a look before run this program.
4.	The main program is main.cpp, which accepts as the input the improved coordinates of packings (0-csq, 1-scu, 2-cci), which lie in the folder "coords/", and outputs the radii of the packings into the files "new_csq_radius.txt", "new_scu_radius.txt", or "new_cci_radius.txt".
