# CheckPackings
This program is used to compute the radius for any packings of equal circles in a square (CSPs).
(1) The improved coordinates by SSP lie in the folder "coords/",
(2) The best-known radii downloaded from http://www.packomania.com/ lie in the file "csq_radius.txt",
(3) The main program is main.cpp, which accepts as the input the improved coordinates of packings, which lie in the folder "coords/", and outputs the radii of the packings.
